ncsa-httpd for Debian
---------------------

In the spirit of nostalgia, all files are in the classic
directory of /usr/local/etc/httpd.  The main binary is
/usr/local/etc/httpd/httpd.  Documentation and man pages
are in the normal places

It's not a good idea to run this in a production environment.
